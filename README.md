# A note on plagarism
If you are currently in the class: *DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN YOUR PROJECT*. 
MIT License does *not* enable its use in a school assignment. 
Plagiarizing will get you suspended or expelled, I've seen it happen before.
You're welcome to read it and fill gaps in understanding in C++ or basic programming constructs, such as function calls and syntax, *not* the algorithms and logical structure of the program.
